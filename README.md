# newsapp
A front end react-native app which displays daily news articles, lets you add to favorites, and makes api calls to newsapi.org. The app uses redux, has three types of navigation, stack, tab and drawer, icons, and dispatches calls to the api and stores the article data in the redux store's global state.  To use it simply get your own api key from newsapi.org and copy and paste it into the fetch('url') function to see the data.
